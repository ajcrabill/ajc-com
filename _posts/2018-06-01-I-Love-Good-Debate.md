Does the concept of the 30M word gap enable or occlude our efforts to serve economically disadvantaged students? Should theoretical physics be more focused on observation than on mathematics? These are great questions and we all benefit from them being asked and explored. When academic debate ensues, everyone wins. Points are clarified, ideas are challenged, and sacred beliefs are laid bare. Through this process we step toward an ever more clear understanding of the remarkable universe and society surrounding us.
